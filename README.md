🎭 Theory Behind Chess Game Implementation
Chess is a two-player strategy game that requires a well-structured rule-based system to handle movement, captures, and game state evaluation.
Implementing a chess game in JavaScript involves:
Board Representation: Using an 8x8 grid with each square assigned unique coordinates.
Piece Movement: Each chess piece has specific movement rules that need to be validated before making a move.
Turn-Based Logic: Players take alternate turns, ensuring fair gameplay.
Capturing Mechanism: Pieces capture opponent’s pieces by moving into their position.
